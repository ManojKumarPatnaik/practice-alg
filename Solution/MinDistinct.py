  Finds the smallest required number of moves to make all elements in the array pairwise distinct.

  Args:
    A: A list of integers within the range [1..N].

  Returns:
    The smallest required number of moves, or -1 if the result is greater than 1,000,000,000.

  # Iterate over the array and calculate the number of moves required to make each element unique.
  for i in range(len(A)):

    # The desired index is simply i + 1, since we want all elements to be unique and in ascending order.
