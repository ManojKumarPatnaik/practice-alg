def solution(S):
  """
  Determines the length of the longest symmetric substring that can be obtained after replacing question marks with "<" or ">" characters.

  Args:
    S (str): The input string containing "<", ">", and/or "?" characters.

  Returns:
    int: The length of the longest symmetric substring.

  Examples:
    >>> solution("")  # Empty string
    0
    >>> solution("<>")
    2
    >>> solution("<<>>")
    4
    >>> solution("<<<>>>")
    6
    >>> solution("?????")
    4
